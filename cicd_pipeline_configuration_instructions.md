     - **Test**: Run automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and static code analysis, to ensure code quality.
     - **Artifact Storage**: Store the build artifacts in a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry) or a file storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
  3. Ensure that the pipeline scripts are version-controlled along with the Agentic System code.
  4. Example GitLab CI configuration:
     ```yaml
     stages:
       - build
       - test
       - deploy
     
     build:
       stage: build
       image: docker:latest
       services:
         - docker:dind
       before_script:
         - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" $CI_REGISTRY
       script:
         - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
         - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
       tags:
         - docker
     
     test:
       stage: test
       image: python:3.9
       before_script:
         - pip install -r requirements.txt
       script:
         - python -m pytest
       tags:
         - docker
     
     deploy:
