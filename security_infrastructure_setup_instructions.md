# Agentic System Security Infrastructure Setup Instructions

## Introduction

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up the security infrastructure as the fourth task of Phase 1 (Foundation and Infrastructure Setup) of the Agentic System Pre-Production Roadmap (`pre_production_roadmap.md`). As outlined in the Phase 1 Infrastructure Setup Plan (`phase1_infrastructure_setup.md`), this task focuses on establishing security measures to protect the development environment and ensure compliance with security requirements (SWREQ-IL-SEC-001, SWREQ-BE-AUTH-001). This setup is critical to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access and must be completed within Weeks 3-4 of the 4-week Phase 1 timeline.

## Objectives

- Implement Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define roles and policies for access control.
- Configure SSL/TLS for all communications between services, databases, and external integrations.
- Set up initial authentication mechanisms using JWT for internal API access during development.
- Deploy security scanning tools within the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early.
- Document security policies and access control procedures for team reference.

## Timeline

- **Duration**: 2 weeks (Weeks 3-4 of Phase 1)
- **Start Date**: Immediately following completion of Task 3 (CI/CD Pipeline Configuration)
- **End Date**: End of Week 4

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Task 1: Cloud Environment Setup, with configured VPC, subnets, and compute resources.
- Completion of Task 2: Database Configuration, with provisioned database instances and access credentials.
- Completion of Task 3: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, with a functional CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, testing, and deployment.
- Approval of the Phase 1 Infrastructure Setup Plan (`phase1_infrastructure_setup.md`).
- Team members with expertise in cloud security, IAM, and DevOps practices.
- Access to necessary tools and software licenses for security setup.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Implement Identity and Access Management (IAM)
**Objective**: Use cloud provider IAM services to define roles and policies for access to environments, databases, and CI/CD tools, ensuring least privilege access.

- **Action**:
  1. Log in to the cloud provider's management console (e.g., AWS Management Console, assuming AWS was selected in Task 1).
  2. Navigate to the IAM service (e.g., AWS IAM).
  3. Define IAM roles for different personas or services that need access to the Agentic System resources:
     - **Administrator**: Full access to all resources for managing the infrastructure and application.
     - **Developer**: Access to code repositories, build servers, and development environments for code development and testing.
     - **QA Engineer**: Access to testing environments and test reports for quality assurance.
     - **Database Administrator**: Access to database instances for management and maintenance.
     - **Application Service**: Limited access to specific resources required for the application to function (e.g., database access, API access).
  4. Create IAM policies that define the permissions for each role, following the principle of least privilege (i.e., granting only the minimum necessary permissions).
  5. Attach the IAM policies to the corresponding IAM roles.
  6. Example IAM policy for developers to access EC2 instances:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "ec2:DescribeInstances",
             "ec2:StartInstances",
             "ec2:StopInstances",
             "ec2:RebootInstances"
           ],
           "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:account-id:instance/*"
           ],
           "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
               "ec2:ResourceTag/Environment": "development"
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
- **Responsible**: Security Engineer / DevOps Engineer
- **Output**: Defined IAM roles and policies for access control, with configurations documented.

### Step 2: Configure SSL/TLS
**Objective**: Enable SSL/TLS for all communications between services, databases, and external integrations to secure data in transit.

- **Action**:
  1. Obtain SSL/TLS certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or use a service like AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to provision certificates.
  2. Configure SSL/TLS for the following components:
     - **Load Balancers**: Enable HTTPS listeners on load balancers to encrypt traffic between clients and the Agentic System.
     - **Web Servers**: Configure web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to use SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.
     - **Database Connections**: Enforce SSL/TLS for all database connections, as configured in Task 2 (Database Configuration).
     - **API Endpoints**: Secure all API endpoints with HTTPS and enforce SSL/TLS for client connections.
     - **External Integrations**: Ensure that all external integrations (e.g., JIRA, GitHub) use HTTPS and enforce SSL/TLS for data exchange.
  3. Verify that SSL/TLS is properly configured by testing the connections using tools like `openssl` or web browser developer tools.
  4. Document the SSL/TLS configurations, including certificate details, expiration dates, and renewal procedures.
- **Responsible**: Security Engineer / DevOps Engineer
- **Output**: SSL/TLS enabled for all communications, with configurations verified and documented.

### Step 3: Set Up Initial Authentication
**Objective**: Implement a basic JWT-based authentication service for internal API access during development, to be expanded in later phases (SWREQ-BE-AUTH-001).

- **Action**:
  1. Implement a JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication service to secure internal API access during development.
  2. Create an authentication endpoint that accepts user credentials (e.g., username and password) and generates a JWT upon successful authentication.
  3. Configure the API endpoints to require a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header for access.
  4. Implement middleware or interceptors to validate the JWT before allowing access to the API endpoints.
  5. Store user credentials securely using a hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to protect against password breaches.
  6. Example code snippet for JWT authentication in Node.js:
     ```javascript
     const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
     const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
     
     // Authentication endpoint
     app.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
       const { username, password } = req.body;
       
       // Find user in database
       const user = await User.findOne({ username });
       if (!user) {
         return res.status(401).send('Invalid credentials');
       }
       
       // Compare password with hashed password
       const validPassword = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
       if (!validPassword) {
         return res.status(401).send('Invalid credentials');
       }
       
       // Generate JWT
       const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, 'secretKey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
       
       res.send({ token });
     });
     
     // Middleware to verify JWT
     function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
       const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
       const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
       
       if (!token) {
         return res.sendStatus(401);
       }
       
       jwt.verify(token, 'secretKey', (err, user) => {
         if (err) {
           return res.sendStatus(403);
         }
         
         req.user = user;
         next();
       });
     }
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineer / Security Engineer
- **Output**: JWT-based authentication service implemented for internal API access, with code and configuration documented.

### Step 4: Deploy Security Tools
**Objective**: Install security scanning tools within the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early.

- **Action**:
  1. Integrate security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the Agentic System codebase for vulnerabilities.
  2. Select security scanning tools based on the programming languages and technologies used in the Agentic System (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk, OWASP ZAP, Trivy).
  3. Configure the security scanning tools to run as part of the build or test stages in the pipeline.
  4. Configure the pipeline to fail if any vulnerabilities are detected by the security scanning tools, preventing vulnerable code from being deployed to the environments.
  5. Generate security reports as part of the pipeline, providing visibility into the vulnerabilities identified and recommendations for remediation.
  6. Example configuration for integrating Trivy into a GitLab CI pipeline:
     ```yaml
     test:
       stage: test
       image: aquasec/trivy:latest
       script:
         - trivy image --exit-code 0 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
       tags:
         - docker
     ```
- **Responsible**: Security Engineer / DevOps Engineer
- **Output**: Security scanning tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, with automated vulnerability scanning and generated security reports.

### Step 5: Document Security Policies
**Objective**: Create initial security policies and access control documentation for team reference, to be updated as the system evolves.

- **Action**:
  1. Create a security policy document that outlines the security principles, guidelines, and procedures for the Agentic System.
  2. Include the following topics in the security policy document:
     - Access control policies
     - Authentication and authorization procedures
     - Data encryption standards
     - Vulnerability management process
     - Incident response plan
     - Security awareness training
  3. Create access control documentation that describes the IAM roles, permissions, and access restrictions for different users and services.
  4. Store the security policy document and access control documentation in a secure location that is accessible to the development team, QA team, and operations team.
  5. Regularly review and update the security policy document and access control documentation to reflect changes in the Agentic System and the threat landscape.
