# Agentic System Pre-Production Roadmap: Phases 2-6 Summary Plan

This document provides a summary plan for Phases 2 through 6 of the Agentic System Pre-Production Roadmap (`pre_production_roadmap.md`). It outlines the key objectives, tasks, and deliverables for each phase, providing a high-level overview of the remaining steps to achieve a fully functional pre-production system.

## Phase 2: Backend and Integration Development (Weeks 5-12)

**Objective**: Develop the backend services and integration layer to support core functionalities and external system connectivity as per software requirements (`implementation/software_engineering/SWE.1_software_requirements_analysis/ASP_SWRS_SoftwareRequirementsSpecification_v1.0.md`).

- **Tasks**:
  - Implement RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication.
  - Develop authentication and authorization services with JWT and RBAC.
  - Create connectors for external systems including Google Suite, JIRA, Git, and DOORS.
  - Implement asynchronous processing for long-running tasks and caching for frequently accessed data.
  - Set up data backup and recovery mechanisms.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional backend APIs with documentation.
  - Integration connectors for specified external systems.
  - Authentication and authorization service implementation.
  - Performance optimization features (asynchronous processing, caching).
  - Data backup and recovery procedure documentation.

## Phase 3: AI Agent Layer Development (Weeks 13-20)

**Objective**: Develop the AI agent layer with natural language processing and coordination capabilities as outlined in agent definitions (`agent_definitions/`) and requirements (SWREQ-AG-NLP-001 to SWREQ-AG-COORD-001).

- **Tasks**:
  - Implement natural language processing (NLP) capabilities using a foundation model like GPT-4.
  - Develop intent recognition and entity extraction modules.
  - Create response generation logic to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations.
  - Build agent coordination mechanisms to manage multiple specialized agents.
  - Establish a knowledge base access system for agents to retrieve organizational standards, templates, and historical data.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional NLP and intent recognition modules.
  - Response generation system with sample interactions.
  - Agent coordination framework with test scenarios.
  - Knowledge base integration with initial content.

## Phase 4: Frontend Development and UI Enhancement (Weeks 21-28)

**Objective**: Enhance the UI mockups into a fully interactive frontend, incorporating user feedback on structure and usage, and aligning with frontend requirements (SWREQ-FE-UI-001 to SWREQ-FE-I18N-001).

- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React) with state management (e.g., Redux) for the frontend.
  - Restructure UI based on user feedback:
    - Dashboard: Design as a KPI summary for admin users only (currently displayable), with content revision planned later.
    - Projects: Develop as the main activity page showing user-assigned projects, detailed views with document trees via API, and a Live Agent Workspace for prompt-based actions.
    - Agents, Documents, Analytics: Restructure as sub-pages under Projects, focusing on project-specific agent activity, document changes, and data analysis respectively.
    - Web Automation: Prioritize in navigation before Settings.
    - Settings: Add feature toggle functionality for all features/sub-features, restricted to admin users later (currently displayable).
  - Add dynamic features with mock real-time updates using WebSockets simulation.
  - Include AI agent interaction interfaces (e.g., chat windows) in relevant sections like Projects and Agents to simulate user-agent communication.
  - Ensure responsive design and initial accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Interactive frontend application with updated structure.
  - Simulated real-time update interfaces.
  - AI agent interaction mockups integrated into UI.
  - Responsive design and accessibility compliance documentation.

## Phase 5: System Integration and Testing (Weeks 29-36)

**Objective**: Integrate all system components, test functionality, and ensure compliance with requirements and ASPICE processes as per the project management plan (`implementation/management_processes/MAN.3_project_management/ASP_PMP_ProjectManagementPlan_v1.0.md`).

- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate frontend with backend APIs and AI agent layer for seamless data flow and interaction.
  - Test external system integrations (e.g., Google Suite, JIRA) for data exchange and authentication.
  - Conduct comprehensive testing including unit, integration, system, performance, and security tests to validate requirements.
  - Simulate ASPICE compliance workflows in the UI, ensuring project management, risk tracking, and quality control features align with documented processes.
  - Implement data auditing and transaction management to ensure data integrity during testing.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Fully integrated system with tested components.
  - Test reports for unit, integration, system, performance, and security tests.
  - ASPICE compliance workflow simulation in UI.
  - Data integrity and transaction management validation reports.

## Phase 6: Pre-Production Validation and Refinement (Weeks 37-40)

**Objective**: Validate the system in a pre-production environment, refine based on feedback, and prepare for production deployment, aligning with the deployment phase in the implementation plan.

- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy the system to a pre-production environment mirroring production settings for final validation.
  - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders to validate functionality, usability, and compliance with user feedback on structure (e.g., Dashboard for admins, Projects sub-pages).
  - Refine UI and features based on UAT feedback, ensuring all toggles in Settings work for feature enable/disable as per user request.
  - Finalize documentation for user guides, technical operations, and API usage to support transition to production.
  - Implement final security and performance optimizations based on pre-production testing results.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Pre-production system deployment with validation reports.
  - UAT feedback and refinement documentation.
  - Finalized user, technical, and API documentation.
  - Security and performance optimization reports.

## Conclusion

This summary plan provides a high-level overview of the remaining phases (2-6) in the Agentic System's pre-production roadmap. By following this plan, the project will progress towards a fully functional pre-production system, addressing the gaps identified in the review report, incorporating user feedback, and aligning with the strategic goals of enhancing automotive project management through AI-driven automation.
