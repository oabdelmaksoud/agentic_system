# Agentic System Pre-Production Roadmap

## Introduction

This roadmap outlines the transition of the Agentic System from its current state of static UI mockups to a fully functional pre-production phase where every feature is implemented and every aspect operates as expected. It is based on the findings and recommendations from the `review_report.md`, as well as the detailed project documentation including the implementation plan, architecture, software requirements, agent definitions, and ASPICE compliance processes. The roadmap focuses on addressing identified gaps, implementing key functionalities, and ensuring alignment with the strategic goals of automating and enhancing ASPICE processes and project management through an AI-powered multi-agent system.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this pre-production phase are:
- Implement all features and sub-features as outlined in the software requirements specification.
- Ensure full functionality of dynamic interactions, AI agent capabilities, and external system integrations.
- Align the system with ASPICE compliance processes and project management best practices.
- Restructure the UI to reflect user feedback on page hierarchy, visibility, and specific functionalities.
- Prepare the system for production deployment with robust security, accessibility, and performance measures.

## Roadmap Overview

The roadmap is structured into distinct phases, each with specific tasks, timelines, and deliverables. The timeline assumes a start date immediately following the approval of this roadmap and is estimated to span 6-9 months to reach pre-production readiness, aligning with the phased approach in the implementation plan (`implementation_plan/implementation_plan.md`). Each phase builds on the previous, ensuring incremental progress and continuous validation.

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured path to transition the Agentic System from static UI mockups to a fully functional pre-production system over a 40-week period. It addresses the gaps identified in the `review_report.md`, incorporates user feedback on system usage and structure, and aligns with the comprehensive project documentation. By following this phased approach, the system will achieve full feature implementation, dynamic functionality, AI agent integration, ASPICE compliance, and external system connectivity, meeting the strategic goals of enhancing automotive project management through AI-driven automation. Regular reviews and stakeholder feedback will be critical throughout to ensure alignment and adaptability as development progresses.
