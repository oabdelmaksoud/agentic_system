# Agentic System Local Environment Setup Instructions

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up a local development environment on your machine to run and test the Agentic System UI mockups with the updated layout. This setup will allow you to verify the changes and simulate key functionalities before moving to cloud deployment.

## Objectives

- Install necessary development tools such as Node.js and a code editor.
- Set up a project directory and copy the updated UI mockup files into it.
- Run a local web server to serve the HTML mockups.
- Simulate dynamic features with placeholder content for testing.
- Verify that the layout changes are correctly implemented and the navigation functions as expected.

## Prerequisites

- A local machine with administrator privileges to install software.
- Basic familiarity with web development tools and environments.
- The updated UI mockup files in the `Webapp Mockup/` directory.
- The `layout_changes_summary.md` file for reference on the implemented layout changes.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install Development Tools

1.  **Install Node.js (LTS version)**:
    *   Download the latest LTS version of Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
    *   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
    *   Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following commands:
        ```bash
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```
    *   These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

2.  **Install a Code Editor (Optional)**:
    *   If you don't already have a code editor, install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from the official website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    *   VS Code is a popular and versatile code editor that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development.

3.  **Install a Local Web Server Tool**:
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt.
    *   Install the `http-server` package globally using npm:
        ```bash
        npm install -g http-server
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in web server if you have Python installed:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
    *   The `http-server` package provides a simple and easy-to-use web server for serving static files.

### Step 2: Set Up Project Directory

1.  **Create a Project Directory**:
    *   Create a new directory on your local machine to host the Agentic System UI mockups (e.g., `agentic_system_local`).
    *   Choose a location that is easily accessible and where you have write permissions.

2.  **Copy UI Mockup Files**:
    *   Copy the contents of the `Webapp Mockup/` directory from the Agentic System project to the newly created project directory (`agentic_system_local`).
    *   Ensure that all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files are copied to maintain the integrity of the file paths and links between the pages.

### Step 3: Run Local Server

1.  **Navigate to Project Directory**:
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt.
    *   Navigate to the project directory (`agentic_system_local`) using the `cd` command:
        ```bash
        cd /path/to/agentic_system_local
        ```

2.  **Start Local Server**:
    *   If you installed `http-server`, run the following command:
        ```bash
        http-server
        ```
    *   This will start a local web server, typically on port 8080.
    *   If you prefer to use Python's built-in web server, run the following command:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
    *   This will start a local web server on port 8000.

3.  **Access the Application**:
    *   Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
    *   Enter the local server address in the address bar:
        *   If using `http-server`, the address is typically `http://localhost:8080`.
        *   If using Python's web server, the address is `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   Navigate to the `index.html` file to access the Agentic System UI mockups.

### Step 4: Simulate Dynamic Features

1.  **Edit HTML Files**:
    *   Open the HTML files in a code editor (e.g., VS Code).
    *   Add placeholder JavaScript or static content to simulate dynamic interactions.
    *   For example, in `agentic_system_projects.html`, add mock data for the project list and chat window text in the Live Agent Workspace.
    *   In `agentic_system_settings.html`, use basic HTML/CSS to create toggle interfaces for feature enable/disable simulation.

2.  **Add Placeholder Content**:
    *   Use HTML comments or JavaScript code to indicate that the content is a placeholder and will be replaced with actual dynamic data in later development phases.
    *   For example:
        ```html
        <!-- Placeholder for Project List -->
        <ul>
            <li>Project 1</li>
            <li>Project 2</li>
            <li>Project 3</li>
        </ul>
        ```

### Step 5: Test Layout Changes

1.  **Verify Navigation**:
    *   Ensure that the navigation reflects the updated hierarchy, with Projects as the main page and sub-pages for Agents, Documents, and Analytics.
    *   Verify that Web Automation is prioritized before Settings in the navigation menu.

2.  **Test Visibility Notes**:
    *   Check that the Dashboard and Settings pages display the note indicating that they are restricted to admin users only (currently displayable).
    *   Ensure that the sub-page relationships are visually clear and intuitive.

3.  **Test Responsiveness**:
    *   Resize the browser window to test the responsiveness of the layout across different screen sizes and devices.
    *   Ensure that the content adapts appropriately and remains readable on smaller screens.

### Step 6: Document Local Setup

1.  **Create a README File**:
    *   Create a new file named `README.md` in the project directory (`agentic_system_local`).
    *   Add the following information to the file:
        *   Project title: Agentic System UI Mockups - Local Setup
        *   Description: Instructions for setting up and running the Agentic System UI mockups locally.
        *   Prerequisites: List of required tools (Node.js, code editor, etc.).
        *   Setup Instructions: Step-by-step instructions for installing tools, copying files, and starting the local server.
        *   Navigation Instructions: A brief guide on how to navigate the updated layout and test the simulated features.
        *   Troubleshooting Tips: Common issues and solutions for setting up the local environment.

## Deliverables

- Local project directory (`agentic_system_local`) with updated UI mockups ready for testing.
- Running local web server to serve the Agentic System mockups.
- Simulated dynamic features with placeholder content for testing.
- Documentation or README file for local setup and navigation instructions.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Approval of this local environment setup instructions.
- Completion of layout changes to the UI mockups.
- Access to the user's local machine with necessary permissions to install development tools.
- Availability of current UI mockup files in `Webapp Mockup/` directory.
- User feedback on layout changes as the guiding specification for restructuring.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

- **Compatibility Issues**: Potential compatibility issues with local tools or server setup on the user's machine. Mitigation: Provide multiple options for local server setup (e.g., Node.js, Python) and detailed troubleshooting steps in documentation.
- **Incomplete Simulation**: Inability to fully simulate dynamic or cloud-dependent features locally. Mitigation: Use static placeholders or mock data to represent dynamic content, focusing on layout and navigation testing initially.
- **User Familiarity**: Lack of familiarity with web development tools and environments. Mitigation: Provide clear and concise instructions with screenshots and examples to guide the user through the setup process.

## Conclusion

These Local Environment Setup Instructions provide a clear and actionable guide for setting up a local development environment to test the Agentic System UI mockups with the updated layout. By following the outlined steps, you will be able to verify the changes, simulate key functionalities, and prepare for further development and testing before moving to cloud deployment.
