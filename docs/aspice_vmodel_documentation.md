# ASPICE V-Model Documentation Structure

## Overview

This document outlines the documentation structure for the Agentic System Platform based on the Automotive SPICE (ASPICE) V-model. The V-model is a systems development model that illustrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing. The documentation structure follows the ASPICE process reference model, covering both system and software engineering processes.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized according to the ASPICE V-model, with separate sections for system engineering and software engineering processes. Each process has its own set of documents that capture the inputs, activities, and outputs of that process.

- **Minor Version**: Incremented for minor changes that do not affect the document's content or structure.

For example:
```
v1.0 - Initial release
v1.1 - Minor updates
v2.0 - Major revision
```

### Document Review and Approval

Documents should go through the following review and approval process:

1. **Draft**: Initial creation of the document.
2. **Review**: Review of the document by relevant stakeholders.
3. **Update**: Update of the document based on review feedback.
4. **Approval**: Approval of the document by authorized approvers.
5. **Release**: Release of the document for use.

### Document Storage and Access

Documents should be stored in a centralized document management system with appropriate access controls. The document management system should support:

- Version control
