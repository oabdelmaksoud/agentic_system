# Agentic System External System Connectors Implementation Instructions

## Introduction

This document provides detailed instructions for creating connectors for external systems as the third task of Phase 2 (Backend and Integration Development) of the Agentic System Pre-Production Roadmap (`pre_production_roadmap.md`). As outlined in the Phase 2 Backend and Integration Development Plan (`phase2_backend_integration_plan.md`), this task focuses on developing connectors for external systems including Google Suite, JIRA, Git, and DOORS, with data transformation and authentication management capabilities (SWREQ-INT-CON-001, SWREQ-INT-AUTH-001). This is a critical step in enabling integration with external tools and must be completed within Weeks 7-10 of the 8-week Phase 2 timeline.

## Objectives

- Identify the specific data and functionalities that need to be integrated from each external system.
- Implement API clients for each external system to interact with their APIs and retrieve data.
- Implement data transformation logic to map data from external systems to the Agentic System data models.
- Implement authentication management to securely store and manage credentials for accessing external systems.
- Test integrations to ensure data is retrieved and transformed correctly.
- Document the integration process for team reference.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Required Integrations
**Objective**: Determine the specific data and functionalities that need to be integrated from each external system.

- **Action**:
  1. Review the software requirements and project documentation to identify the data and functionalities needed from each external system:
     - **Google Suite**: Integration for document collaboration (Google Docs), email communication (Gmail), and calendar scheduling (Google Calendar).
     - **JIRA**: Integration for project tracking, issue management, and workflow automation.
     - **Git**: Integration for version control, code repository access, and commit history.
     - **DOORS**: Integration for requirements management and traceability.
  2. Define the specific API endpoints or services to be used for each integration.
  3. Document the integration requirements, including data types, frequency of data sync, and required functionalities.
- **Responsible**: Integration Architect / System Analyst
- **Output**: Documented integration requirements for Google Suite, JIRA, Git, and DOORS.

### Step 2: Implement API Clients
**Objective**: Develop API clients for each external system to interact with their APIs and retrieve data.

- **Action**:
  1. Choose appropriate libraries or SDKs for interacting with the APIs of each external system (e.g., Google APIs Client Library, Atlassian JIRA REST API client, GitHub API client, IBM Rational DOORS API).
  2. Implement API clients to handle HTTP requests, parse responses, and manage pagination or rate limiting if applicable.
  3. Example code snippet for a Google Suite API client in Python using `google-api-python-client`:
     ```python
     from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
     from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
     from googleapiclient.discovery import build
     
     SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly']
     
     def get_google_drive_service():
         creds = None
         if os.path.exists('token.json'):
             creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file('token.json', SCOPES)
         if not creds or not creds.valid:
             flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', SCOPES)
             creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
             with open('token.json', 'w') as token:
                 token.write(creds.to_json())
         return build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)
     
     service = get_google_drive_service()
     results = service.files().list(pageSize=10, fields="nextPageToken, files(id, name)").execute()
     items = results.get('files', [])
     for item in items:
         print(f"{item['name']} ({item['id']})")
     ```
- **Responsible**: Integration Engineers / Backend Engineers
- **Output**: Functional API clients for Google Suite, JIRA, Git, and DOORS, capable of interacting with their respective APIs.

### Step 3: Implement Data Transformation
**Objective**: Implement data transformation logic to map data from external systems to the Agentic System data models.

- **Action**:
  1. Define mapping rules to transform data from the format provided by external systems to the format required by the Agentic System data models.
  2. Implement transformation logic to handle data fields, data types, and data structures.
  3. Handle data inconsistencies or missing data by implementing fallback mechanisms or default values.
  4. Example transformation logic for mapping JIRA issues to Agentic System project tasks:
     ```javascript
     function transformJiraIssueToTask(issue) {
         return {
             id: issue.key,
             title: issue.fields.summary,
             description: issue.fields.description || '',
             status: issue.fields.status.name,
             assignee: issue.fields.assignee ? issue.fields.assignee.displayName : 'Unassigned',
             created: issue.fields.created,
             updated: issue.fields.updated,
             projectId: issue.fields.project.key
         };
     }
     
     const jiraIssue = // ... fetched JIRA issue data
     const task = transformJiraIssueToTask(jiraIssue);
     // Save transformed task to Agentic System database
     ```
- **Responsible**: Integration Engineers / Data Engineers
- **Output**: Data transformation logic implemented for mapping external system data to Agentic System data models.

### Step 4: Implement Authentication Management
**Objective**: Implement authentication management to securely store and manage credentials for accessing external systems.

- **Action**:
  1. Use a secure credential storage solution (e.g., environment variables, a secrets management service like AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault) to store API keys, tokens, and other credentials.
  2. Implement OAuth 2.0 or similar authentication flows for systems that support it (e.g., Google Suite, JIRA, GitHub).
  3. Handle token refresh and expiration to maintain continuous access to external systems.
  4. Example code snippet for managing OAuth tokens for Google Suite:
     ```python
     from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
     from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
     
     def refresh_credentials():
         SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly']
         creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file('token.json', SCOPES)
         if creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
             creds.refresh(Request())
             with open('token.json', 'w') as token:
                 token.write(creds.to_json())
         return creds
     ```
- **Responsible**: Security Engineer / Integration Engineers
- **Output**: Authentication management implemented, with secure credential storage and token refresh mechanisms.

### Step 5: Test Integrations
**Objective**: Thoroughly test the integrations to ensure that data is being retrieved and transformed correctly, and that authentication mechanisms are working as expected.

- **Action**:
  1. Write unit tests to validate the functionality of API clients and data transformation logic.
  2. Write integration tests to simulate real-world data retrieval and transformation scenarios.
  3. Test error handling for scenarios such as API downtime, rate limiting, and invalid credentials.
  4. Use mock servers or sandbox environments provided by external systems for testing if available.
- **Responsible**: QA Engineers / Integration Engineers
- **Output**: Test reports for unit and integration tests, confirming correct data retrieval, transformation, and authentication.

### Step 6: Document Integrations
**Objective**: Document the integration process, including API endpoints, data mappings, and authentication procedures.

- **Action**:
  1. Create detailed documentation for each integration, covering:
     - API endpoints used for data retrieval or interaction.
     - Data mappings between external system data and Agentic System data models.
     - Authentication setup and credential management.
     - Error handling and fallback mechanisms.
  2. Include code snippets or configuration examples to assist developers in troubleshooting or extending integrations.
  3. Store the documentation in a secure location accessible to the development and operations teams.
- **Responsible**: Technical Writer / Integration Engineers
- **Output**: Comprehensive integration documentation for Google Suite, JIRA, Git, and DOORS.

## Deliverables
