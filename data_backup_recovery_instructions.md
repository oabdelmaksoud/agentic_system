## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Database Backups
**Objective**: Set up automated backups for PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases to ensure regular data protection.

- **Action**:
  1. For **PostgreSQL**:
     - Use tools like `pg_dump` or cloud provider backup services (e.g., AWS RDS Automated Backups) to schedule regular backups.
     - Configure backup frequency (e.g., daily full backups with incremental backups every 6 hours).
     - Example command for scheduling a daily backup with `pg_dump` on a Linux server:
       ```bash
       # Create a backup script
       cat > /usr/local/bin/backup_postgres.sh << 'EOL'
       #!/bin/bash
       PGPASSWORD="your_password" pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost your_database > /backups/postgres_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
       EOL
       
       # Make the script executable
       chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup_postgres.sh
       
       # Add to crontab to run daily at 2 AM
       (crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup_postgres.sh") | crontab -
       ```
  2. For **MongoDB**:
     - Use `mongodump` or cloud provider services (e.g., MongoDB Atlas Backup) to schedule regular backups.
     - Configure backup frequency similar to PostgreSQL for consistency.
     - Example command for scheduling a daily backup with `mongodump`:
       ```bash
       # Create a backup script
       cat > /usr/local/bin/backup_mongo.sh << 'EOL'
       #!/bin/bash
       mongodump --host localhost --port 27017 --username admin --password your_password --archive=/backups/mongo_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).archive
       EOL
       
       # Make the script executable
       chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup_mongo.sh
       
       # Add to crontab to run daily at 3 AM
       (crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 3 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup_mongo.sh") | crontab -
       ```
  3. Ensure backups are compressed to save storage space if not handled by the cloud provider.
- **Responsible**: Database Administrator / DevOps Engineer
- **Output**: Automated backup schedules configured for PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases.

### Step 2: Implement Backup Retention Policies
**Objective**: Define and implement backup retention policies to manage storage usage and comply with data retention requirements.

- **Action**:
  1. Define retention periods based on compliance needs and storage constraints (e.g., retain daily backups for 7 days, weekly backups for 4 weeks, monthly backups for 12 months).
  2. Implement scripts or use cloud provider features to automatically delete backups older than the retention period.
  3. Example script for cleaning up old PostgreSQL backups:
     ```bash
     # Create a cleanup script
     cat > /usr/local/bin/cleanup_postgres_backups.sh << 'EOL'
     #!/bin/bash
     find /backups/ -name "postgres_backup_*.sql" -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;
     EOL
     
     # Make the script executable
     chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cleanup_postgres_backups.sh
     
     # Add to crontab to run daily at 4 AM
     (crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 4 * * * /usr/local/bin/cleanup_postgres_backups.sh") | crontab -
     ```
- **Responsible**: Database Administrator / Compliance Officer
- **Output**: Backup retention policies defined and implemented for PostgreSQL and MongoDB backups.

### Step 3: Test Backup and Recovery Procedures
**Objective**: Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure data can be restored in a timely and accurate manner.

- **Action**:
  1. Create a test environment or use a staging database instance to simulate recovery scenarios.
  2. Perform recovery tests by restoring backups to the test environment and verifying data integrity and completeness.
  3. Document the recovery time and any issues encountered during the process.
  4. Example command for restoring a PostgreSQL backup:
     ```bash
     # Restore a specific backup
     PGPASSWORD="your_password" psql -U postgres -h localhost your_database < /backups/postgres_backup_20250508.sql
     ```
  5. Example command for restoring a MongoDB backup:
     ```bash
     # Restore a specific backup
     mongorestore --host localhost --port 27017 --username admin --password your_password /backups/mongo_backup_20250508.archive
     ```
- **Responsible**: Database Administrator / QA Engineer
- **Output**: Test reports documenting successful backup restoration and recovery times for PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

### Step 4: Implement Disaster Recovery Plan
**Objective**: Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan outlining steps to be taken in the event of a major outage or disaster.

- **Action**:
  1. Define disaster scenarios (e.g., hardware failure, data corruption, cyberattack) and their potential impact on the Agentic System.
  2. Outline recovery steps for each scenario, including:
     - Identifying the scope of data loss or system downtime.
     - Restoring data from the most recent backup.
     - Validating restored data and system functionality.
     - Notifying stakeholders and documenting the incident.
  3. Assign roles and responsibilities for executing the disaster recovery plan.
  4. Schedule regular disaster recovery drills to test the plan's effectiveness.
- **Responsible**: Disaster Recovery Specialist / DevOps Engineer
- **Output**: Documented disaster recovery plan with defined scenarios, recovery steps, and assigned responsibilities.

### Step 5: Store Backups Securely
**Objective**: Store backups in a secure location separate from the primary data storage to protect against data loss due to hardware failures or security breaches.

- **Action**:
  1. Use a cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) or an offsite backup server for storing backups.
  2. Configure access controls to restrict backup access to authorized personnel only.
  3. Encrypt backups to protect sensitive data during transit and at rest.
  4. Example command for uploading PostgreSQL backups to AWS S3:
     ```bash
     # Install AWS CLI if not already installed
     # pip install awscli
     
     # Upload backup to S3
     aws s3 cp /backups/postgres_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql s3://your-backup-bucket/postgres_backups/
     ```
- **Responsible**: Security Engineer / Database Administrator
- **Output**: Backups stored securely in a separate location with access controls and encryption.
