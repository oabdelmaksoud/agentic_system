     - User authentication and authorization
     - Project management (create, read, update, delete projects)
     - Agent management (deploy, configure, monitor agents)
     - Document management (upload, retrieve, update documents)
     - Analytics data retrieval
     - Web automation task management
  2. **Implement API Logic**: Develop the backend logic for each API endpoint, including data validation, business rules, and database interactions.
  3. **Implement Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to handle exceptions, validate user inputs, and return meaningful error messages to the frontend.
  4. **Implement Data Validation**: Implement data validation to ensure that all data received from the frontend is valid and conforms to the expected data types and formats.
  5. **Document APIs**: Document all API endpoints using a standard format such as OpenAPI (Swagger) to provide clear and concise documentation for the frontend developers.
  6. Example API endpoint for creating a new project:
     ```
     POST /projects
     Content-Type: application/json
     Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
     
     {
       "name": "New Project",
       "description": "A new project description",
       "owner_id": 123
     }
     
     Response:
     {
       "id": 456,
       "name": "New Project",
       "description": "A new project description",
       "owner_id": 123,

  4. **Secure API Endpoints**: Configure the API endpoints to require authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users and services can access them.
  5. **Implement Session Management**: Implement session management to track user activity and automatically log out inactive users after a specified period of time.
  6. **Integrate with IAM**: Integrate the authentication and authorization services with the cloud provider's IAM service (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure AD) for centralized user management.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional JWT-based authentication service.
  - RBAC authorization implemented for API endpoints.
  - Defined user roles with specific permissions.
  - Integration with cloud provider's IAM service.
