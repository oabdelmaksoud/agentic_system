# Agent Definitions

## Overview

This directory contains detailed specifications for each agent in the Agentic System. The agents are organized into three main categories:

1. **Project Management Agents**: Agents focused on project management activities
2. **Technical Agents**: Agents focused on technical activities related to the V-model
3. **Support Agents**: Agents that provide common support functions

## Agent Categories

### Project Management Agents

Project Management Agents are responsible for automating and enhancing project management activities. They focus on planning, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing project execution.

#### Key Agents:

- [Project Management Agent](project_management/project_management_agent.md): Oversees project planning, execution, and monitoring
- [Risk Management Agent](project_management/risk_management_agent.md): Identifies, analyzes, and mitigates project risks
- [Change Management Agent](project_management/change_management_agent.md): Manages project changes and their impact
- [Resource Management Agent](project_management/resource_management_agent.md): Optimizes resource allocation and utilization
- [Quality Assurance Agent](project_management/quality_assurance_agent.md): Ensures project quality standards are met
- [Communication Agent](project_management/communication_agent.md): Facilitates project communication and reporting
- [Stakeholder Management Agent](project_management/stakeholder_management_agent.md): Manages stakeholder engagement and expectations
- [Process Improvement Agent](project_management/process_improvement_agent.md): Identifies and implements process improvements

### Technical Agents

Technical Agents are responsible for automating and enhancing technical activities related to the V-model. They focus on requirements, design, implementation, testing, and verification.

#### Key Agents:

- [Technical Agent](technical/technical_agent.md): Manages requirements elicitation, analysis, and specification
- [System Architecture Agent](technical/system_architecture_agent.md): Designs and validates system architecture
- [Software Architecture Agent](technical/software_architecture_agent.md): Designs and validates software architecture
- [Detailed Design Agent](technical/detailed_design_agent.md): Creates and validates detailed design
- [Implementation Agent](technical/implementation_agent.md): Generates and reviews code
- [Unit Testing Agent](technical/unit_testing_agent.md): Creates and executes unit tests
- [Integration Testing Agent](technical/integration_testing_agent.md): Creates and executes integration tests
- [System Testing Agent](technical/system_testing_agent.md): Creates and executes system tests
- [Qualification Testing Agent](technical/qualification_testing_agent.md): Creates and executes qualification tests
- [Traceability Agent](technical/traceability_agent.md): Maintains traceability across the V-model

### Support Agents

Support Agents provide common support functions that are used by both Project Management and Technical Agents. They focus on cross-cutting concerns and infrastructure services.

#### Key Agents:

- [Documentation Agent](support/documentation_agent.md): Creates and maintains documentation
- [Knowledge Management Agent](support/knowledge_management_agent.md): Manages organizational knowledge and best practices
- [Learning Agent](support/learning_agent.md): Learns from experience and improves agent performance
- [Integration Agent](support/integration_agent.md): Integrates with external tools and systems
- [Monitoring Agent](support/monitoring_agent.md): Monitors agent performance and system health
- [Security Agent](support/security_agent.md): Ensures system security and compliance
- [Orchestration Agent](support/orchestration_agent.md): Coordinates the activities of other agents
- [User Interface Agent](support/user_interface_agent.md): Provides user interfaces for human interaction

## Agent Structure

Each agent is defined with the following structure:

### 1. Overview

A brief description of the agent's purpose and role in the system.

### 2. Responsibilities

A detailed list of the agent's responsibilities and tasks.

### 3. Capabilities

The specific capabilities and skills that the agent possesses.

### 4. Inputs and Outputs

The inputs that the agent consumes and the outputs that it produces.

### 5. Interactions

The interactions that the agent has with other agents and external systems.

### 6. Implementation Details

Technical details about the agent's implementation, including:

- **Foundation Model**: The foundation model used by the agent
- **Fine-tuning**: Any fine-tuning applied to the foundation model
- **Knowledge Base**: The knowledge base used by the agent
- **Tools and APIs**: The tools and APIs used by the agent
- **Execution Environment**: The environment in which the agent executes

### 7. Performance Metrics

The metrics used to measure the agent's performance.

### 8. Limitations and Constraints

Any limitations or constraints on the agent's capabilities.

### 9. Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the agent's capabilities.

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate with each other through a standardized message protocol. The protocol includes:

- **Message Type**: The type of message (request, response, notification)
- **Sender**: The agent sending the message
- **Receiver**: The agent receiving the message
- **Content**: The content of the message
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the message

## Agent Coordination

Agents are coordinated by the Orchestration Agent, which:

- Distributes tasks to appropriate agents
- Manages agent workflows
- Monitors agent performance
- Handles agent failures
- Optimizes agent utilization

## Agent Deployment

Agents can be deployed in various configurations:

- **Standalone**: Agents deployed as standalone services
- **Clustered**: Multiple instances of the same agent deployed for scalability
- **Embedded**: Agents embedded in other applications
- **Serverless**: Agents deployed as serverless functions

## Agent Development

New agents can be developed and added to the system. The development process includes:

1. **Definition**: Define the agent's purpose, responsibilities, and capabilities
2. **Design**: Design the agent's architecture and interfaces
3. **Implementation**: Implement the agent using the Agent Framework
4. **Testing**: Test the agent's functionality and performance
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the agent to the production environment
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor the agent's performance and health
7. **Improvement**: Continuously improve the agent based on feedback and performance metrics
