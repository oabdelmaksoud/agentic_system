## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Implement JWT Authentication
**Objective**: Implement a JWT-based authentication service to verify the identity of users and services accessing the Agentic System APIs.

- **Action**:
  1. Choose a JWT library for the backend framework or language (e.g., `jsonwebtoken` for Node.js, `PyJWT` for Python).
  2. Implement an authentication endpoint (e.g., `/auth/login`) that accepts user credentials (e.g., username and password) as input.
  3. Validate the user credentials against the user database.
  4. If the credentials are valid, generate a JWT containing user information (e.g., user ID, username, roles) and sign it with a secret key.
  5. Return the JWT to the client in the response.
  6. Example code snippet for JWT authentication in Node.js with Express:
     ```javascript
     const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
     const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
     
     app.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
       const { username, password } = req.body;
       
       // Find user in database
       const user = await User.findOne({ username });
       if (!user) {
         return res.status(401).send('Invalid credentials');
       }
       
       // Compare password with hashed password
       const validPassword = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
       if (!validPassword) {
         return res.status(401).send('Invalid credentials');
       }
       
       // Generate JWT
       const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id, role: user.role }, 'secretKey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
       
       res.send({ token });
     });
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineer / Security Engineer
- **Output**: JWT-based authentication service implemented, with code and configuration documented.

### Step 2: Implement RBAC Authorization
**Objective**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities.

- **Action**:
  1. Define a set of roles with specific permissions for accessing different resources and functionalities in the Agentic System.
  2. Implement middleware or interceptors to validate the JWT and check if the user has the required role to access the requested resource.
  3. Configure the API endpoints to require specific roles for access, using the authentication middleware.
  4. Example code snippet for RBAC authorization in Node.js with Express:
     ```javascript
     function authorize(roles) {
       return (req, res, next) => {
         const userRole = req.user.role;
         
         if (roles.includes(userRole)) {
           next();
         } else {
           res.status(403).send('Unauthorized');
         }
       };
     }
     
     app.get('/admin/dashboard', authenticateToken, authorize(['admin']), (req, res) => {
       res.send('Admin dashboard');
     });
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineer / Security Engineer
- **Output**: RBAC authorization implemented for API endpoints, with defined user roles and permissions.

### Step 3: Define User Roles
**Objective**: Define user roles such as Administrator, Project Manager, Technical Lead, and Support Engineer, each with specific permissions.

- **Action**:
  1. Define the following user roles:
     - **Administrator**: Full access to all resources and functionalities, including user management, system configuration, and security settings.
     - **Project Manager**: Access to project management functionalities, such as creating, updating, and deleting projects, assigning agents, and managing documents.
     - **Technical Lead**: Access to technical functionalities, such as code review, testing, and deployment.
     - **Support Engineer**: Access to support functionalities, such as documentation management, knowledge base management, and user support.
  2. Define the specific permissions for each role, outlining which resources and functionalities they can access.
  3. Document the user roles and permissions in a clear and concise manner for team reference.
- **Responsible**: Security Architect / System Architect
- **Output**: Defined user roles with specific permissions, documented for team reference.

### Step 4: Secure API Endpoints
**Objective**: Configure the API endpoints to require authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users and services can access them.

- **Action**:
  1. Apply the authentication middleware to all API endpoints that require authentication.
  2. Apply the authorization middleware to all API endpoints that require specific roles for access.
  3. Test the API endpoints to ensure that they are properly secured and that only authorized users can access them.
  4. Example code snippet for securing API endpoints in Node.js with Express:
     ```javascript
     app.get('/projects', authenticateToken, authorize(['project_manager', 'admin']), (req, res) => {
       // Only project managers and administrators can access this endpoint
       res.send(projects);
     });
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineers / Security Engineer
- **Output**: API endpoints secured with authentication and authorization, with access restrictions enforced.

### Step 5: Implement Session Management
**Objective**: Implement session management to track user activity and automatically log out inactive users after a specified period of time.

- **Action**:
  1. Use a session management library (e.g., `express-session` for Node.js) to manage user sessions.
  2. Configure the session management library to store session data in a secure and scalable manner (e.g., using Redis or Memcached).
  3. Set a session timeout value to automatically log out inactive users after a specified period of time (e.g., 30 minutes).
  4. Implement a mechanism to refresh the session timeout on each user request to keep active sessions alive.
  5. Implement a logout endpoint to allow users to manually terminate their sessions.
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineers / Security Engineer
- **Output**: Session management implemented, with session timeout, session refresh, and logout functionality.

### Step 6: Integrate with IAM
**Objective**: Integrate the authentication and authorization services with the cloud provider's IAM service (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure AD) for centralized user management.

- **Action**:
  1. Configure the authentication and authorization services to authenticate users against the cloud provider's IAM service.
  2. Use the IAM service to manage user accounts, roles, and permissions.
  3. Implement a synchronization mechanism to keep the user accounts and roles in the Agentic System synchronized with the IAM service.
  4. This step may require using MCP servers to add new tools and resources to its capabilities.
- **Responsible**: Security Engineer / DevOps Engineer
- **Output**: Authentication and authorization services integrated with the cloud provider's IAM service, with user accounts and roles managed centrally.
