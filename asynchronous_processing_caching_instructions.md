## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Long-Running Tasks
**Objective**: Identify tasks that may take a long time to complete and can benefit from asynchronous processing.

- **Action**:
  1. Review the system requirements and API endpoints to identify tasks that are computationally intensive or involve external system interactions.
  2. Examples of long-running tasks in the Agentic System may include:
     - Generating compliance reports for ASPICE processes.
     - Processing large datasets from external systems like JIRA or DOORS.
     - Performing complex calculations for analytics or performance metrics.
     - Executing web automation tasks that require waiting for responses from external websites.
  3. Document the identified long-running tasks, including their expected execution time and frequency of execution.
- **Responsible**: Performance Engineer / System Analyst
- **Output**: Documented list of long-running tasks suitable for asynchronous processing.

### Step 2: Implement Asynchronous Processing
**Objective**: Implement asynchronous processing for long-running tasks using message queues or task queues.

- **Action**:
  1. Choose a message queue or task queue solution suitable for the system's architecture (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Celery with Redis, Sidekiq for Ruby).
  2. Set up the message queue or task queue infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability.
  3. Modify the API endpoints or backend logic to offload long-running tasks to the queue instead of processing them synchronously.
  4. Implement worker processes or background jobs to consume tasks from the queue and execute them asynchronously.
  5. Ensure proper error handling and retry mechanisms for failed tasks.
  6. Example code snippet for using Celery with Redis in Python for asynchronous report generation:
     ```python
     from celery import Celery
     
     app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')
     
     @app.task
     def generate_compliance_report(project_id):
         # Simulate long-running task
         import time
         time.sleep(10)  # Simulate report generation
         report_data = f"Compliance report for project {project_id}"
         # Save report data to database or file system
         return report_data
     
     # In API endpoint
     @app.route('/reports/compliance/<int:project_id>', methods=['POST'])
     def request_compliance_report(project_id):
         task = generate_compliance_report.delay(project_id)
         return jsonify({'task_id': task.id}), 202
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineers / Performance Engineers
- **Output**: Asynchronous processing implemented for identified long-running tasks, using a message queue or task queue.

### Step 3: Implement Caching
**Objective**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data using a caching solution to reduce database load and improve response times.

- **Action**:
  1. Choose a caching solution suitable for the system's needs (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
  2. Identify data that is frequently accessed and relatively static, such as user profiles, project metadata, or compliance rules.
  3. Implement caching at appropriate layers (e.g., application layer, database query layer) to store and retrieve frequently accessed data.
  4. Example code snippet for caching with Redis in Node.js:
     ```javascript
     const redis = require('redis');
     const client = redis.createClient();
     
     async function getProjectData(projectId) {
         const cacheKey = `project:${projectId}`;
         let projectData = await client.get(cacheKey);
         
         if (projectData) {
             return JSON.parse(projectData);
         }
         
         // If not in cache, fetch from database
         projectData = await Project.findById(projectId);
         
         // Store in cache with expiration time (e.g., 1 hour)
         await client.setEx(cacheKey, 3600, JSON.stringify(projectData));
         
         return projectData;
     }
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineers / Performance Engineers
- **Output**: Caching implemented for frequently accessed data, using a caching solution like Redis or Memcached.

### Step 4: Configure Cache Invalidation Policies
**Objective**: Configure cache invalidation policies to ensure that cached data remains up-to-date and consistent with the source data.

- **Action**:
  1. Define cache invalidation strategies based on data update frequency and criticality (e.g., time-based expiration, event-based invalidation).
  2. Implement mechanisms to invalidate or update cache entries when the underlying data changes.
  3. Example code snippet for event-based cache invalidation in Node.js:
     ```javascript
     async function updateProject(projectId, updatedData) {
         // Update project in database
         await Project.update(projectId, updatedData);
         
         // Invalidate cache entry
         const cacheKey = `project:${projectId}`;
         await client.del(cacheKey);
     }
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineers / Performance Engineers
- **Output**: Cache invalidation policies configured to maintain data consistency.

### Step 5: Monitor Performance
**Objective**: Monitor the performance of asynchronous processing and caching mechanisms to ensure they improve system performance.

- **Action**:
  1. Integrate performance monitoring tools to track metrics such as task execution time, queue length, cache hit/miss ratio, and API response times.
  2. Set up alerts for performance anomalies, such as long queue wait times or low cache hit rates.
  3. Analyze performance data to identify bottlenecks or areas for further optimization.
  4. Adjust configurations (e.g., number of workers, cache size, expiration times) based on performance analysis.
- **Responsible**: Performance Engineers / DevOps Engineers
- **Output**: Performance monitoring reports and optimizations based on collected data.
