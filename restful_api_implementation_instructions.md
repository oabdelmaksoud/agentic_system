  3. Define the request and response formats for each API endpoint, using JSON as the standard data format.
  4. Document the API endpoints in a clear and concise manner, including the HTTP method, URL, request parameters, request body, and response format.
- **Responsible**: Backend Architect / API Designer
- **Output**: Defined API endpoints with request and response formats documented.

### Step 2: Implement API Logic
**Objective**: Develop the backend logic for each API endpoint, including data validation, business rules, and database interactions.

- **Action**:
  1. Choose a backend framework or language (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask or Django) to implement the API logic.
  2. Implement the logic for each API endpoint, including:
     - **Data Validation**: Validate the request data to ensure that it is valid and conforms to the expected data types and formats.
     - **Business Rules**: Implement the business rules and logic for each API endpoint, such as calculating compliance scores, assigning agents to projects, or processing web automation tasks.
     - **Database Interactions**: Interact with the PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases to retrieve, store, and update data as needed.
  3. Use a consistent coding style and follow best practices for code organization, modularity, and testability.
  4. Example code snippet for creating a new project in Node.js with Express:
     ```javascript
     app.post('/projects', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
       try {
         const { name, description, owner_id } = req.body;
         
         // Validate input data
         if (!name || !description || !owner_id) {
           return res.status(400).send('Missing required fields');
         }
         
         // Create new project in database
         const newProject = await Project.create({ name, description, owner_id });
         
         res.status(201).send(newProject);
       } catch (error) {
         console.error(error);
         res.status(500).send('Internal server error');
       }
     });
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineers
- **Output**: Implemented backend logic for all API endpoints, with data validation, business rules, and database interactions.

### Step 3: Implement Error Handling
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive error handling to handle exceptions, validate user inputs, and return meaningful error messages to the frontend.

- **Action**:
  1. Implement a global exception handler to catch any unhandled exceptions that occur in the API logic.
  2. Implement custom error classes for different types of errors, such as validation errors, authentication errors, authorization errors, and database errors.
  3. Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions within the API endpoints and return appropriate error responses to the frontend.
  4. Include detailed error messages in the responses to help the frontend developers troubleshoot issues.
  5. Log all errors to a centralized logging system for monitoring and analysis.
  6. Example code snippet for error handling in Node.js with Express:
     ```javascript
     app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
       console.error(err.stack);
       
       if (err instanceof ValidationError) {
         return res.status(400).send({ message: err.message, errors: err.errors });
       }
       
       res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
     });
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineers / Security Engineer
- **Output**: Comprehensive error handling implemented for all API endpoints, with custom error classes and detailed error messages.

### Step 4: Implement Data Validation
**Objective**: Implement data validation to ensure that all data received from the frontend is valid and conforms to the expected data types and formats.

- **Action**:
  1. Use a data validation library (e.g., Joi, Yup, Express Validator) to define validation schemas for the request data.
  2. Implement validation middleware or interceptors to validate the request data before it reaches the API logic.
  3. Return detailed validation error messages to the frontend if the request data is invalid.
  4. Example code snippet for data validation in Node.js with Express Validator:
     ```javascript
     const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
     
     app.post('/users', [
       body('username').isLength({ min: 5 }).withMessage('Username must be at least 5 characters long'),
       body('email').isEmail().withMessage('Invalid email address'),
       body('password').isLength({ min: 8 }).withMessage('Password must be at least 8 characters long')
     ], async (req, res) => {
       const errors = validationResult(req);
       if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
         return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
       }
       
       // Create new user in database
       const newUser = await User.create(req.body);
       
       res.status(201).send(newUser);
     });
     ```
- **Responsible**: Backend Engineers
- **Output**: Data validation implemented for all API endpoints, with detailed validation error messages.

### Step 5: Document APIs
**Objective**: Document all API endpoints using a standard format such as OpenAPI (Swagger) to provide clear and concise documentation for the frontend developers.

- **Action**:
  1. Use a tool like Swagger UI or Redoc to generate API documentation from the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification.
  2. Include the following information for each API endpoint:
     - HTTP method
     - URL
     - Request parameters
     - Request body
     - Response format
     - Example requests and responses
     - Error codes
  3. Host the API documentation on a publicly accessible URL for the frontend developers to easily access.
  4. Example OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for creating a new project:
     ```yaml
     paths:
       /projects:
         post:
           summary: Create a new project
