# Agentic System Pre-Production Roadmap: Phase 3 - AI Agent Layer Development Plan

This document provides a detailed plan for Phase 3 of the Agentic System Pre-Production Roadmap, focusing on the development of the AI Agent Layer. This phase spans Weeks 13-20 and aims to implement natural language processing and coordination capabilities as outlined in agent definitions (`agent_definitions/`) and requirements (SWREQ-AG-NLP-001 to SWREQ-AG-COORD-001).

## Objective
Develop the AI agent layer with natural language processing (NLP) and coordination capabilities to enable intelligent interaction and task management within the Agentic System.

## Timeline
- **Duration**: Weeks 13-20 (8 weeks)
- **Start Date**: [To be determined based on Phase 2 completion]
- **End Date**: [To be determined based on Phase 2 completion]

## Tasks and Deliverables

### 1. Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) Capabilities
   - **Objective**: Enable agents to understand and process natural language inputs using a foundation model like GPT-4.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Select and integrate a suitable foundation model (e.g., GPT-4) for NLP tasks.
     - Develop preprocessing pipelines for text input to handle various formats and languages.
     - Implement API calls to the foundation model for processing user commands and queries.
   - **Deliverable**: Functional NLP module capable of processing user inputs with sample test cases.
   - **Timeline**: Weeks 13-14
   - **Responsible**: AI Development Team

### 2. Develop Intent Recognition and Entity Extraction Modules
   - **Objective**: Accurately identify user intents and extract relevant entities from natural language inputs.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Train or fine-tune models for intent classification based on predefined agent roles (e.g., Project Management, Technical, Support).
     - Implement entity extraction to identify key elements like project names, deadlines, and task types.
     - Create a feedback loop to improve recognition accuracy based on user interactions.
   - **Deliverable**: Intent recognition and entity extraction modules with accuracy metrics and test scenarios.
   - **Timeline**: Weeks 15-16
   - **Responsible**: AI Development Team

### 3. Create Response Generation Logic
   - **Objective**: Generate meaningful and contextually relevant responses to user inputs.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Develop templates and logic for response generation based on intent and entity data.
     - Integrate with the foundation model to produce natural language responses.
     - Implement error handling for misunderstood commands, prompting users for clarification.
   - **Deliverable**: Response generation system with sample interactions demonstrating meaningful feedback and recommendations.
   - **Timeline**: Weeks 16-17
   - **Responsible**: AI Development Team

### 4. Build Agent Coordination Mechanisms
   - **Objective**: Enable multiple specialized agents to collaborate and manage tasks effectively.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Design a coordination framework to assign tasks to appropriate agents based on their roles and expertise.
     - Implement communication protocols between agents for task handoff and status updates.
     - Develop conflict resolution strategies for overlapping agent responsibilities.
   - **Deliverable**: Agent coordination framework with test scenarios showing multi-agent collaboration.
   - **Timeline**: Weeks 17-18
   - **Responsible**: System Integration Team

### 5. Establish Knowledge Base Access System
   - **Objective**: Allow agents to retrieve and utilize organizational standards, templates, and historical data.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up a knowledge base repository with relevant documents and data.
     - Implement search and retrieval mechanisms for agents to access the knowledge base.
     - Ensure security and access control to protect sensitive information.
   - **Deliverable**: Knowledge base integration with initial content and access system for agents.
   - **Timeline**: Weeks 19-20
   - **Responsible**: Data Management Team

## Dependencies
- **Phase 2 Completion**: Backend APIs and integration layer must be functional to support AI agent interactions.
- **Hardware and Software Requirements**: Access to GPU resources for model training and API keys for foundation model integration.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Delays in model training or integration due to resource constraints.
  - **Mitigation**: Secure resources in advance and prioritize critical components for early development.
- **Risk**: Accuracy issues in intent recognition or response generation.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement iterative testing and feedback loops to refine models continuously.

## Conclusion
Phase 3 focuses on building the AI Agent Layer, a critical component of the Agentic System that enables intelligent interaction through natural language processing and agent coordination. By completing the outlined tasks, we will establish a robust foundation for AI-driven automation in automotive project management, aligning with the strategic goals of the project.
