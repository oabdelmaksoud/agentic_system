## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Select Monitoring Tools
**Objective**: Choose appropriate monitoring tools for metrics collection and visualization to track the health and performance of the Agentic System.

- **Action**: Evaluate monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, or CloudWatch based on the following criteria:
  - **Metrics Collection**: Ensure the tool can collect a wide range of metrics from compute instances, Kubernetes clusters, databases, and applications.
  - **Visualization**: Select a tool with robust dashboarding and visualization capabilities to create meaningful insights from the collected metrics.
  - **Alerting**: Choose a tool that supports flexible alerting rules to notify the team of critical issues.
  - **Integration with Cloud Provider**: Ensure seamless integration with the selected cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for resource monitoring and management.
- **Decision**: Document the chosen tools and rationale in a decision log for team reference. For example, select Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization due to their open-source nature and integration with Kubernetes.
- **Responsible**: DevOps Engineer / Monitoring Specialist
- **Output**: Decision log entry specifying the selected monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana).

### Step 2: Deploy Monitoring Agents
**Objective**: Install monitoring agents on all compute instances and Kubernetes clusters to collect metrics on CPU, memory, disk usage, and application performance.

- **Action**:
  1. For compute instances:
     - Install a node exporter (e.g., Prometheus Node Exporter) on each compute instance to collect system-level metrics.
     - Configure the node exporter to expose metrics on a specific port (e.g., 9100).
  2. For Kubernetes clusters:
     - Deploy the Prometheus Operator to manage Prometheus instances and related resources within the Kubernetes clusters.
     - Deploy cAdvisor (Container Advisor) on each node in the Kubernetes clusters to collect container-level metrics.
     - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the node exporters and cAdvisor instances.
  3. Example configuration for deploying Prometheus Node Exporter on Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.3.1/node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
     tar -xvf node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
     cd node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64
     sudo cp node_exporter /usr/local/bin
     sudo useradd -rs /bin/false node_exporter
     sudo chown node_exporter:node_exporter /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
     sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service > /dev/null <<EOF
     [Unit]
     Description=Prometheus Node Exporter
     Wants=network-online.target
     After=network-online.target

     [Service]
     User=node_exporter
     Group=node_exporter
     Type=simple
     ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     EOF
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl start node_exporter
     sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
     ```
- **Responsible**: DevOps Engineer / Monitoring Specialist
- **Output**: Monitoring agents deployed on all compute instances and Kubernetes clusters, with configurations documented.

### Step 3: Configure Dashboards
**Objective**: Set up initial dashboards in Grafana to visualize key metrics for development, testing, and staging environments.

- **Action**:
  1. Install and configure Grafana to connect to the Prometheus data source.
  2. Create dashboards for each environment (development, testing, staging) to visualize key metrics:
     - **Compute Instance Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic.
     - **Kubernetes Cluster Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, pod status, deployment status.
     - **Database Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, connection count, query performance.
     - **Application Metrics**: Response time, error rate, request volume.
  3. Use pre-built Grafana dashboards or create custom dashboards to visualize the metrics in a meaningful way.
  4. Example Grafana dashboard for Kubernetes cluster monitoring:
     ```json
     {
       "annotations": {
         "list": []
       },
       "editable": true,
       "gnetId": null,
       "graphTooltip": 0,
       "id": null,
       "links": [],
       "panels": [],
       "schemaVersion": 16,
       "style": "dark",
       "tags": [],
       "templating": {
         "list": []
       },
       "time": {
         "from": "now-6h",
         "to": "now"
       },
       "timepicker": {
         "refresh_intervals": [
           "5s",
           "10s",
           "30s",
           "1m",
           "5m",
           "15m",
           "30m",
           "1h",
           "2h",
           "1d"
         ]
       },
       "timezone": "browser",
       "title": "Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring"
     }
     ```
- **Responsible**: DevOps Engineer / Monitoring Specialist
- **Output**: Deployed Grafana with initial dashboards for each environment, visualizing key metrics.

### Step 4: Implement Logging
**Objective**: Deploy a centralized logging solution to aggregate logs from all services and infrastructure components.

- **Action**:
  1. Select a centralized logging solution such as the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, or a cloud-native logging service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, Azure Monitor Logs, Google Cloud Logging).
  2. Configure the Agentic System components to send logs to the centralized logging solution.
  3. Deploy log collectors (e.g., Fluentd, Logstash) on compute instances and Kubernetes clusters to collect logs from various sources.
  4. Configure the logging solution to parse and index the logs, making them searchable and analyzable.
  5. Create dashboards in Kibana or the chosen logging solution to visualize log data and identify patterns or anomalies.
- **Responsible**: DevOps Engineer / Logging Specialist
- **Output**: Centralized logging system operational, with logs aggregated from all services and infrastructure components, and dashboards created for visualization.

### Step 5: Set Up Alerts
**Objective**: Configure alerting rules to notify the team of critical issues via email or messaging platforms like Slack.

- **Action**:
  1. Define alerting rules based on key metrics and log patterns to detect critical issues, such as high CPU usage, low memory, service downtime, or security vulnerabilities.
  2. Configure Prometheus Alertmanager or the cloud provider's monitoring service to send alerts to a communication platform such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email.
  3. Customize the alerts to include relevant information, such as the affected component, the severity of the issue, and a link to the relevant dashboard or log data.
  4. Test the alerting rules to ensure that they are triggered correctly and that the notifications are sent to the appropriate channels.
- **Responsible**: DevOps Engineer / Monitoring Specialist
- **Output**: Configured alerting rules with notification setup, with alerts sent to the appropriate communication channels.

### Step 6: Document Monitoring Setup
**Objective**: Create documentation for monitoring and logging configurations, including how to access dashboards and interpret alerts.

- **Action**:
  1. Create a document that describes the monitoring and logging setup for the Agentic System.
  2. Include the following information in the document:
     - List of monitoring tools and logging solutions used.
     - Instructions for accessing the dashboards and log data.
     - Description of the key metrics and log patterns being monitored.
     - Explanation of the alerting rules and notification procedures.
     - Troubleshooting tips for common monitoring and logging issues.
  3. Store the documentation in a secure location that is accessible to the development team, QA team, and operations team.
- **Responsible**: DevOps Engineer / Technical Writer
- **Output**: Monitoring and logging setup documentation, stored in a secure location.
